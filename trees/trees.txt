=== What are trees? ===
- Trees are a data structure that have a hierarchical structures 
  as opposed to linked lists and arrays which are liner
- The nodes can contain any type of information that we want

=== What is abstruct syntax tree? ===

=== What are Binary Trees? ===
- Each node can only have either zero, one or two nodes
- Each child can only have one parent
- Each node represents a certain state
- The number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number og nodes
  on all the other levels plus one

=== Misc ===
- Linked lista are also a type of trees
- There are so many different kinds of trees
- Perfect Binary Tree
  - Everything is filled in
  - All the leaf nodes are full (have 2 children)
  - Perfect binary trees are very efficient and desiable
- Full Binary Tree
  - Each node has eitehr zero or two children but not one child

=== Big O of Binary Trees ===
- lookup: O(log N)
- insert: O(log N)
- delete: O(log N)
