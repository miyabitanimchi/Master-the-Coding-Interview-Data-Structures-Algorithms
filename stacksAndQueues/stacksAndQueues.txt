=== Stacks and Queues ===
- They are both linear data structures, which allow us to traverse data sequentially one by one
- They are similar, the main difference is only how items get removed

=== Stacks ===
- They are like plates stacked on top of each other vertically
- Can only touch the top plate
- Called LIFO, last in, first out, because the last plate comes out first
- Stacks are used in such as browser history
- Methods
    - pop O(1)
    - oush O(1)
    - peek O(1) ... view the top plate
    - (loopup O(n)) ... it's gonna be a heavy operation!

=== MISC notes ===
- Most programming languages are modeled with the stack architecture in mind
-
