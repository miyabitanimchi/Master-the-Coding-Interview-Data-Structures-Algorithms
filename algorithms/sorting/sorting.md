### Bubble sort

- One of the basic sorting algorithms
- Not really efficient for time complexity (Avarage and worst, O(n^2) O of n squared)
- space complexity is O(1)

### Selection sort

- The algorithm works by scanning a list of items for the smallest element and then swapping that element for the one in the first position
- Like bubble sort the time complexity is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(1)
