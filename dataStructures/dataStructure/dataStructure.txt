Data structure - Collection of values
Algorithms - Steps or processes we put into place to manipulate the collection of values

How to build data structure?
How to use it?

How computers store data
- Variables and numbers are stored in what we call random access memory, RAM for short
- Processor => CPU
- There are "addresses" (like shelves) to hold information in RAM
- Each shelve holds 8 bits
- 8bits is called 1 byte
- Data structure remmembers ways for us to store information
- Cache memory - work between CPU and RAM
- CPU is connected to a "memory controller" and it reads and writes data in the memor
- Memory controller has connection to each shelves

Operations on data structures
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Access
- Searching
- Sorting
