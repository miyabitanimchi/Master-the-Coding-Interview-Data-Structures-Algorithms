Big O - Big O Asymptotic Analysis

Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long
an algorithm takes to run

- O(n): Linear Time
- O(1): Constant Time
- O(n2): Quadratic Time

BIG O Rules:
1. Worst Case - we alwqys think about the worst case, like the item might be placed at the very end of an array
2. Remove Constants - What we care is how steep the line is, but how the line moves as inputs increase e.g. (3n + 100) => (n)
3. Different terms for inputs - Different inputs different variables
4. Drop non dominants - only keep the most dominant / significant part
