What is good code?

1. Readable
2. Scalable
    - Speed - How fast is the runtime on the code? How much time does it take for a function to run? How many operations does it cost?
    - Memory - memory required by the algorithm

Two ways to remember when a program executes
    - Heap => Usually where we store variables that we assign values to
    - Stack => Usually where we keep track of our function calls.


Sometimes readability may be matters more than scalability.
Sometimes optimizing for time or space can negatively impact the readability of code
