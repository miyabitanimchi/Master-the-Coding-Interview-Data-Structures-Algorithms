What is a pointer?
- Reference to another place in memory, another object or another node


const obj1 = { a: true };
let obj2 = obj1; <= a poiner, a reference to the obj1
// both obj1 and obj2 point to the same location in memory

obj1.a = false;
console.log(obj1); => { a: false }
console.log(obj2); => { a: false }

delete obj1; // obj2 is not pointing to the memory space anymore?

console.log(obj1) => reference error
console.log(obj2) => { a: false } // it still points to the memory space even though obj1 is deleted;


obj2 = "hello planet"; 
// then nothing points to the memory space anymore so the data will be deleted automatically (it's called GARBAGE COLLECTION)
// But if it's low level languages, we need to manage the memory manually
