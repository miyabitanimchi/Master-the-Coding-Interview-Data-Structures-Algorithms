=== What is a Linked List? ===
- A list that is Linked
- Contains a set of nodes and think of nodes as these blocks
- The nodes have two elements
    - A value of data
    - A pointer to the next node in line
- The first node is called the head
- The last node is called the tail
- There is what people call "null terminated", the tail always points to null


there are 2 types:
- Singly Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists




=== Why Linked Lists could be better than Hash Tables in some occasions? ===
- My thought
    - We can keep the order
    - Because of the pointer, somehow we can grab the value we want easily?
    - Unlike arrays, we don't need to shift values when a new value is inserted
