Hash Tables... aka hash maps, maps, Unordered maps, Dictionaries, objects
Objects in JavaScript are a type of hash table.
Hash tables are called diffently in defferent languages (e.g. Python... Dictionaries)

A way hash tables work with is keys used an an indices.

Idempotent... 冪等元（べきとうげん）??

Every time you add a propety and value into a memory, hash function gets executed
to where to store the data

Difference between SHA-256 and MD5?



Problems of Hash Tables... COLLISION
Hash function doesn't evenly distribute the data until every addres is full, 
it ramdomly assigns a space and memory and put the data in there.
Collision is inevitable in hash tables with enough data and limited memory.

When collision is happening, it'll be 
O(n/k)
k is the size of the hash table


There are 2 ways to handle with collisions
